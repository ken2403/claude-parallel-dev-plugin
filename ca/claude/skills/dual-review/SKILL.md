description: Run the ca dual-model review (Codex second opinion + blind Claude review + Claude synthesis) standalone on any PR — no implement loop required. Use to get a Claude-and-Codex joint review of a pull request, to re-review a PR after the ca loop finished, or when the user says "dual review this PR", "review with both Claude and Codex", or invokes /ca:dual-review. Emits the same ca_claude_review.v1 verdict as the loop's final review.

# dual-review

Run the ca loop's dual-model final review as a **standalone command**: an offline
Codex second opinion and a blind Claude review run in parallel, then a separate
Claude synthesis call adjudicates the Codex findings into one
`ca_claude_review.v1` verdict. Works on any PR — mid-loop, after the loop, or on
PRs the loop never touched. You are the ORCHESTRATOR: the judgment happens in the
subprocesses; you set up inputs, run the script, and report the result.

## Preconditions (check first, fail loudly)

- `claude` on PATH (or `CLAUDE_BIN`) and the ca plugin resolvable by `claude -p`
  (installed, or export `CA_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR=<repo>/ca/claude`).
- Network + authenticated `gh` (`gh auth status`).
- `codex` (or `CODEX_BIN`) is OPTIONAL: absent/failing degrades visibly to a
  Claude-only review with the reason in the meta sidecar — never a hard failure.

## Step 1 — Resolve inputs

```bash
PR="<first argument, or auto-detect>"
[ -n "$PR" ] || PR="$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number 2>/dev/null)"
[ -n "$PR" ] || { echo "no PR number given and none found for the current branch" >&2; exit 1; }
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

**Plan/intent file** — the reviewers judge the PR against it:

- If the user gave a plan path (e.g. `docs/ca/plans/<id>.md`), use it. For a
  re-review after a loop, the loop's staged copy also works:
  `.ca/runs/<plan-id>/plan.md`.
- If no plan is given, derive an intent file from the PR itself — the review
  then judges the PR against its stated intent:

  ```bash
  INTENT="$ROOT/.ca/reviews/pr-$PR/intent.md"
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "$INTENT")"
  gh pr view "$PR" --json title,body --jq '"# PR intent: \(.title)\n\n\(.body)"' > "$INTENT"
  ```

**Output dir and round** — keep every artifact (gitignored under `.ca/`):

```bash
OUTDIR="$ROOT/.ca/reviews/pr-$PR"
ROUND=1; while [ -f "$OUTDIR/review-round-$ROUND.json" ]; do ROUND=$((ROUND+1)); done
```

## Step 2 — Run the orchestrator

```bash
CLAUDE_SKILL_CA_DIR="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
bash "$CLAUDE_SKILL_CA_DIR/scripts/dual-review.sh" \
  --pr "$PR" --plan "$INTENT_OR_PLAN" --worktree "$ROOT" \
  --round "$ROUND" --out-dir "$OUTDIR"
```

It runs both legs in parallel (the blind review cannot read the Codex output —
it is being produced concurrently by a process it never opens), synthesizes when
Codex found anything, skips synthesis on a clean full-coverage Codex pass, and
degrades to Claude-only with a machine-readable reason when the Codex leg fails.
If it exits non-zero, report the failure verbatim — do not improvise a verdict.

## Step 3 — Report

Read `review-round-N.json` and the meta sidecar; report to the human:

- **Verdict** (approve / request_changes / blocked) and the summary paragraph.
- Findings as a table: id, blocking, severity, title, file:line.
- When synthesis ran: the `second_opinion.ledger` adjudications
  (confirmed/refuted/not_applicable/unresolved) and any
  `resolved_blind_findings` (blind blockers that synthesis downgraded, with
  evidence).
- The leg statuses from the meta sidecar (e.g. Codex `used` coverage `full`,
  or `unavailable: codex_unavailable_or_oversized` — say plainly when the
  second opinion did NOT happen).

If `--comment` was passed, also post the summary to the PR:

```bash
gh pr review "$PR" --comment --body "<summary>"
```

## Notes

- This is the standalone twin of the implement loop's `CA_DUAL_REVIEW=1` final
  review — same scripts, same contract, same fail-closed semantics. One
  deliberate difference: a Codex-leg input-fetch failure (exit 4) degrades here
  instead of stopping, because the blind leg fetched the same PR in parallel —
  an asymmetric failure is transient.
- Verdicts from this command do NOT promote a draft PR; only the loop's
  final-mode approve does (the loop owns `gh pr ready`).
- The `code-review` standards skill (canonical risky-surface list, four
  dimensions) auto-activates in the `claude -p` review sessions — the criteria
  are the same as sa/ha; only the execution differs.

## References

- `references/review-contract.md` — `ca_claude_review.v1` / `ca_codex_review.v1`
  shapes and gate semantics (byte-identical copy; the canonical set lives with
  each skill that consumes it).
