# Code review standards

The single source of engineering standards for `ca`. It applies in two modes:

- **While implementing** (in `plan-loop` — bake them into the plan Codex builds from): follow these as you
  write, so the change is clean, safe, and consistent the first time.
- **While reviewing** (in `review-pr` (checkpoint and final) / `synthesize-review`): check the diff
  against these and report findings as `severity — file:line — issue — suggestion`.

The existing codebase convention always takes precedence over a general rule — confirm
with `Grep`/`Glob` before flagging something as wrong.

## Four dimensions

- **Quality** — readability, maintainability, simplicity, type safety, error handling,
  performance, matching existing style. → [references/code-quality.md](references/code-quality.md)
- **Test rigor** — behavior coverage of the change: every changed behavior has a test
  that fails without it (boundaries, error paths, state transitions — not line coverage).
  A behavior change without a covering test is a **High/blocking** finding unless the
  author states why it is untestable (in the PR Notes — or in the report, when no PR
  exists yet). → [references/test-rigor.md](references/test-rigor.md)
- **Security** (non-negotiable; must never regress) — injection (SQL/command/path/template),
  authn/authz, secrets, crypto, unsafe deserialization, SSRF, sensitive data in logs,
  dependency risk. → [references/security.md](references/security.md)
- **Consistency beyond the diff** — missed propagation on rename/schema/API/config
  changes, stale references, reinvented logic, docs/types/configs drift, cross-layer
  coherence. → [references/consistency.md](references/consistency.md)

## Risky surfaces (canonical list)

A change is **risky** when it touches: authn/authz/sessions/tokens; crypto/secrets;
money/billing; external-input parsing (HTTP handlers, deserialization, file uploads);
data migration/deletion; permissions; or SQL/shell string construction.
ca's review gates (the checkpoint and final reviews in `review-pr`, the high-risk
escape hatch and Codex-finding adjudication in `synthesize-review`) key off this
list — other ca skills reference it, never re-enumerate it.

## How to apply

1. Understand existing patterns first (`Glob`/`Grep`/`Read`) — style is contextual.
2. Apply the four dimensions inline — ca ships no subagents; the independent second
   opinion is the Codex leg, whose findings `synthesize-review` adjudicates with evidence.
3. Verify findings against the codebase before reporting (a flagged pattern may be
   mitigated by middleware, a framework, or an established convention).

## Report format (when reviewing)

For each finding:
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Location**: file:line
- **Issue**: brief description
- **Suggestion**: specific fix or secure alternative
