# Behavior tests for the generated clean-worktrees clean.sh (run against the ha
# copy — all three plugin copies are generated from the same common source).
#
# Scenario A (one scratch repo, one run):
#   1. merged worktree                     → removed, branch deleted
#   2. unmerged worktree                   → blocked, untouched
#   3. merged + STALE claude-session lock (dead pid) → unlocked, removed
#   4. merged + claude-session lock held by a RUNNING pid → skipped
#   5. merged + DELIBERATE keep-lock whose text contains "rapid N"
#      (adversarial pid-regex bait)        → skipped, NEVER unlocked
#   6. merged + claude-session lock naming pid 1 (another user's LIVE process;
#      `kill -0` would misread EPERM as dead) → skipped as RUNNING
#   7. empty orphan dirs (child + group)   → removed
#   8. non-empty orphan dir                → kept and reported
#   9. UNREADABLE orphan dir (find/rmdir fail) → kept + reported, script
#      completes (no set -e abort) and the other orphans are still processed
#  10. registered depth-1 worktree with an empty subdir → subdir untouched
#
# Scenario B (fresh repo, zero merged worktrees):
#  11. the EARLY-EXIT path also sweeps orphans ("No merged worktrees" + removal)
#
# Scenario C (fresh repo, launched FROM a linked worktree):
#  12. the sweep is anchored at the MAIN checkout (REMOVE_FROM), so orphans
#      under the main checkout's .claude/worktrees are swept even when clean.sh
#      runs inside a linked worktree (GIT_ROOT != main); a merged sibling is
#      still removed from that launch point too.
#
# gh is stubbed to fail fast so merge verification deterministically uses git
# ancestry; global/system git config is neutralized (gpgsign/hooksPath immunity).
