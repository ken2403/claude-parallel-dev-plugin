# Worktree cleanup script for the ha plugin.
# Ported from sa/skills/clean-worktrees/scripts/clean.sh (sa->ha).
#
# Scans linked worktrees via `git worktree list` and removes EVERY worktree —
# regardless of location — whose branch has been merged. This is intentionally
# repo-wide: it reclaims ha/sa/ca worktrees and any other merged worktree, so a
# single run cleans them all. The main checkout is always preserved; the current
# worktree is removed too if its branch is merged. An unmerged branch is never
# deleted.
#
# Follows superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch's cleanup guardrails:
# cd to the main root before removing, merge-verified-only, `git worktree prune`,
# never `--force` / `-D`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/clean.sh [branch | path | all-merged | --all]
#     (no arg / all-merged / --all) → consider every worktree
#     (a name/branch/path) → only that one
#
# Safety:
#   - Considers every worktree in `git worktree list` (any path).
#   - NEVER deletes a worktree whose branch has NOT been merged.
#   - NEVER deletes the main checkout. The CURRENT worktree IS removed if its
#     branch is merged (done from the main checkout, since git refuses to remove
#     the worktree you stand in); skipped only if there is no separate main dir.
#   - NEVER uses `git worktree remove --force` — a worktree with uncommitted
#     changes is skipped and reported, not destroyed.
#   - `git branch -d` (not -D) — refuses to delete an unmerged branch.
#   - Locked worktrees: a MERGED worktree whose lock holder is a dead process
#     (e.g. a finished Claude session's "pid N" lock) is unlocked and removed;
#     a lock held by a RUNNING process, or with no parseable pid, is skipped.
#   - Orphan directories under .claude/worktrees/ (present on disk but not in
#     `git worktree list`): removed only when EMPTY. A non-empty orphan has no
#     git metadata to verify a merge against, so it is reported, never deleted.
