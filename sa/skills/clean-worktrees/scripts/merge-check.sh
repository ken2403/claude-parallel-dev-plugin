# ==============================================================================
# Canonical merge verification for the sa plugin.
#
# This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for branch merge verification logic.
# All commands and scripts should use this implementation.
#
# Usage (sourced):
#   source path/to/merge-check.sh
#   if is_branch_merged "branch-name" "base-branch" [repo-root]; then
#     echo "merged"
#   fi
#
# Parameters:
#   $1 - branch name to check
#   $2 - base branch to check against
#   $3 - repository root (optional, defaults to ".")
#
# Returns: 0 if branch is confirmed merged, 1 otherwise.
# Messages are output to stderr so they don't interfere with stdout capture.
#
# Principle: NEVER return "merged" unless we have POSITIVE PROOF.
# When in doubt, return "not merged" (safe side).
#
# Verification methods (in order):
#   1. gh pr — check GitHub PR state (most reliable, handles squash merge)
#   2. git branch --merged — check local git merge status
#   3. If all methods are inconclusive → return NOT MERGED
